I've worked [here and there](https://stackoverflow.com/story/pi-victor).

I try to write things i've solved so i don't forget about them on the [blog](https://victor.cloudflavor.io).


Most of the projects are WIP because i have a lot of ideas and not that much time, but
here are the ones i'd like to get done one day:
 
- [Kalimera](https://github.com/cloudflavor/kalimera) - Standalone web UI for aws s3 compatible storage services.

- [Njörðr](https://github.com/cloudflavor/njord) - Kubernetes friendly pub-sub platform.

- [Odoo-k8s](https://github.com/cloudflavor/odoo-k8s) - [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) on k8s.

- [Wekan](https://github.com/cloudflavor/wekan-k8s) - [Wekan](https://wekan.github.io/) on k8s.

- [Hurd](https://github.com/PI-Victor/hurd) - A tool to version your microservices.

- [grpc-proxy-gen](https://github.com/cloudflavor/grpc-proxy-gen) - Generate stubs for proxying microservices through your gRPC gateway based on their version.
